## Maktub
Maktube its a pseudo randon generative library designed to generate
theorem tests, procedural objects constructions and anything that you need
pseudo random usage

## Install
These lib its designed to be as dumb as possible


## Quick Usage
these above example generates a simple rand number betwen  0 and 100

codeof:exemples/rand_num.c

## Generating Tokens
you also can generate tokens of diferent sizes of diferent chars

codeof:exemples/generate_token.c

## Choice
you can choice betwen lists with generate choice functionality

codeof:exemples/generate_choice.c


## Probabilities
you can set probabilities for for switching elements
codeof:exemples/num_generation_basic.c

its also possible to use it at a boolean strategy
codeof:exemples/num_generation_bool.c

## Callbacks
you can determine a callback to be executed on each probability

codeof:exemples/subscribe_function.c

## Passing Args to callback
codeof:exemples/subscribe_function_passing_args.c


## Seed Control
all pseudo random numbers are generated based on the seed and on the
generation ,where you can modify and controll it

codeof:exemples/set_generation.c

## Making Seed random modifications
you can make small seed modifications to test varios hipoteses

codeof:exemples/seed_modify.c
